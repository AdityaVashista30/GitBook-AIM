# Updating Car Physics

We have updated the car design and physics for better simulation experience. This update will remove the few bugs that were present. Now the car will run properly and give same results whenever the simulation is started.&#x20;

To update run the following command on terminal:

```
cd ~/ros2ws/nxp_gazebo/ && git pull
```
