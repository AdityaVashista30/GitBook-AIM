# Installation of NXP Gazebo

## Notice

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is advised to have a steady internet collection and system to be plugged onto power as installation and setting up the setup will take a long time to finish. We also advise you to perform this installation on a clean Ubuntu 20.04 installation. If you have previously installed ROS1 Noetic, there may be issues with installation and we advise uninstalling it for the sake of compatibility with NXP Gazebo.
{% endhint %}
